  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As a civil engineer with 4 years of experience, I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to change the world we live in. This has led me to change my career path towards full-stack website development, where I can use my technical background and problem-solving skills to develop innovative digital solutions.<br>

<br>I am now an entry-level full-stack developer looking to use my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to create dynamic, user-friendly websites that meet the needs of businesses and individuals alike. I am highly motivated and always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
<br>
<br>In my previous job as a civil engineer, I honed my skills in project management, teamwork and problem solving. These skills combined with my technical skills make me a strong candidate for any full-stack development role.
